### JupyterLab vs Jupyter notebook
USE JUPYTERLAB

JupyterLab is the newer version of the interface. Just use this.
Some differences:
- modular structure allowing opening multiple notebooks or files. More of an IDE experience
- Run cells using ctrl+enter
- Run code directly in a console with shift+enter
- Inspect variables, dataframes or plots quickly and easier without cluttering notebook output

### install jupyterlab
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

### run jupterlab
```
jupyter-lab
```
